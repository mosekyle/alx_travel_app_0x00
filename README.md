 Creating Models, Serializers, and Seeders

## Overview
This project involves creating models, serializers, and seeders for the Django-based `alx_travel_app_0x00` application. The goal is to define the database structure, represent API data using serializers, and seed the database with sample data.

---

## Objective
- Define the database models for the application.
- Create serializers for API data representation.
- Implement a management command to seed the database with sample data.

---

## Instructions

### 1. Duplicate Project
- Duplicate the project `alx_travel_app` to a new repository named `alx_travel_app_0x00`.

### 2. Create Models
- Navigate to `listings/models.py`.
- Define the following models:
  - **Listing**: Represents properties or items available for booking.
  - **Booking**: Tracks user reservations.
  - **Review**: Stores user feedback on listings.
- Ensure each model includes:
  - Appropriate fields (e.g., `CharField`, `IntegerField`, `ForeignKey`).
  - Relationships (e.g., One-to-Many, Many-to-Many).
  - Constraints (e.g., unique, non-null).

### 3. Set Up Serializers
- Create serializers in `listings/serializers.py`.
- Implement serializers for the **Listing** and **Booking** models.
- Ensure the serializers handle nested relationships if necessary.

### 4. Implement Seeders
- Create a management command in `listings/management/commands/seed.py`.
- Populate the database with sample data for:
  - Listings
  - Bookings
  - Reviews
- Test the seeder by running the command to verify data population.

### 5. Run Seed Command
- Execute the seed command to populate the database:
  ```bash
  python manage.py seed
  ```
